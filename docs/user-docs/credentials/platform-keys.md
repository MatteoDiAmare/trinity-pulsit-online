# Platform Keys: Claude, GitHub, Email and Gemini

The keys a Trinity instance needs, all configurable from the browser — in the first-run setup (re-open it any time from **Settings → General → Re-run setup**), or later under **Settings → Integrations**. No terminal and no `.env` edit is needed for any of them.

| Key | Required? | What it switches on | If you skip it |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| [Claude](#claude) | **Yes** | Every agent's thinking | No agent can run |
| [GitHub access token](#github-access-token) | No | Private repos, pushing agent work to GitHub | Public templates only; no push |
| [Email provider (Resend)](#email-provider-resend) | No | Email-code sign-in for you and anyone you share with | Only the admin password works; codes go to the server log |
| [Gemini](#gemini) | No | Voice conversations, generated agent avatars, Gemini-runtime agents | No voice; no generated avatars |

Every key is checked with its provider **before** it is saved, and stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM) in the platform database — never in plain text. A key saved in Settings takes precedence over the same key in the server's `.env`, and takes effect without a restart.

## Claude

The one credential Trinity cannot run without. The first-run setup will not finish until one is connected (you can choose **Finish later**, but your agents stay idle until you add one).

Two ways to connect — pick one tab:

- **Subscription token** — uses your Claude Pro or Max plan. On any computer where Claude Code is signed in to that plan, run `claude setup-token` and paste the token it prints (it starts with `sk-ant-oat01-`). See [Anthropic's guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication#generate-a-long-lived-token).
- **API key** — pay-as-you-go billing. Create a key in your browser at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) (it starts with `sk-ant-api`). No terminal needed.

Pasting a subscription token into the API key tab (or the other way round) is caught before anything is sent, and the step offers to move it to the right tab.

**What happens when you connect the first credential.** Agents that were created before any Claude credential existed — for example the starter fleet a fresh install comes with — are switched onto it automatically. Running ones restart in the background, which takes about a minute — except one in the middle of a task, which picks the credential up the next time it starts. Agents that were deliberately set up with their own key, or have already completed a run, are left alone. New agents pick up a credential when they are created.

The same connection happens in reverse: **Remove** the API key on an install that has subscriptions registered, and the agents that were running on it move onto a subscription automatically (see [Subscription Credentials](subscription-credentials.md#registering-a-subscription)).

Manage it later: **Settings → Integrations** — the API key field, and the Subscriptions panel for tokens (auto-assign, auto-switch, usage). See [Subscription Credentials](subscription-credentials.md).

## GitHub access token

Lets agents clone private repositories and push their work back to GitHub. Create a token at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=Trinity) with the `repo` scope (classic), or a fine-grained token with **Contents** read/write on the repositories your agents use. It starts with `ghp_` or `github_pat_`.

Saving it also updates running agents that use the platform token. Details: [GitHub PAT Setup](../integrations/github-pat-setup.md).

## Email provider (Resend)

Trinity sends a one-time code to sign in by email — for you, and for anyone you share an agent with. It sends those codes through [Resend](https://resend.com).

1. Create an API key at [resend.com/api-keys](https://resend.com/api-keys) (it starts with `re_`).
2. Verify the domain you want to send from at [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains).
3. Paste the key and a **Send codes from** address on that domain (for example `noreply@your-domain.com`).

The check reads your Resend account's domains and refuses an address whose domain Resend has not verified — Resend would reject every code sent from it. A sending-only key cannot list domains; it is accepted with a warning to confirm the domain yourself. Resend's shared test domain (`resend.dev`) is accepted with a warning too: it delivers only to your own Resend account address.

A key saved here makes Resend the email provider, even if the server's `.env` says otherwise. **Remove** reverts email to the `.env` configuration.

If you skip it, nobody can sign in with an email code — only the admin password works, and the codes are written to the server log instead of being sent.

## Gemini

Powers voice conversations with agents and Telegram voice-note transcription, and generates agent avatars. (Phone calls and the Brain Orb voice tile also use it, but each has its own feature switch as well.) An agent created on the Gemini runtime receives it as `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Create a key at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey); Google AI Studio can issue keys with different prefixes. Trinity checks the key against Google's API when you select **Check & save**.

If you skip it, voice is off and agents get no generated avatars — the starter fleet keeps the pictures it ships with; other agents show initials. Add the key later and voice switches on without a restart; generate avatars with **Generate Default Avatars** under **Settings → General**, or from each agent's avatar menu. See [Voice Chat](../advanced/voice-chat.md) and [Agent Avatars](../advanced/agent-avatars.md).

## For admins and automation

All endpoints are admin-only and never return a key — only whether one is set, where it comes from (`settings` or `env`) and its last four characters.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/settings/api-keys` | Status of `anthropic`, `github`, `resend` (with `provider`, `from_address`), `gemini` |
| `POST /api/settings/api-keys/{anthropic,github,resend,gemini}/test` | Check a key with its provider; nothing is saved |
| `PUT /api/settings/api-keys/{anthropic,github,resend,gemini}` | Save a key (Resend also takes `from_address`). The Anthropic response carries `connected_agents` — how many agents had no credential and now use this one |
| `DELETE /api/settings/api-keys/{anthropic,github,resend,gemini}` | Remove the saved key; the `.env` value, if any, applies again (`fallback_configured`). Removing the Anthropic key moves agents that relied on it onto a registered subscription |
| `POST /api/subscriptions/test` | Check a subscription token (one tiny request on your plan); nothing is saved |
| `POST /api/subscriptions` | Register a subscription token; also returns `connected_agents` |

Environment fallbacks, used only when nothing is saved in Settings: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_PAT`, `RESEND_API_KEY` with `EMAIL_PROVIDER` and `SMTP_FROM`, and `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
